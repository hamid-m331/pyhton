üêç Transfer-JSON-ELK
This repository hosts a Python script designed to streamline the process of transferring, indexing, and managing JSON data into an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) environment. This tool is built for developers, data engineers, and users seeking a fast, programmable solution for ingesting JSON datasets into Elasticsearch.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary objective of this script is to provide an efficient workflow for data ingestion:

Read JSON-formatted data efficiently (e.g., from a local file or a stream) into Python data structures.

Connect to a running Elasticsearch instance using the official Python client.

Index the data optimally (likely leveraging the Bulk Indexing API for high performance) into a specified index.

The indexed data can then be readily searched, analyzed, and visualized using Kibana.

üõ† Prerequisites
To successfully run this script and connect to your ELK environment, you will need:

Python (version 3.x recommended).

A running Elasticsearch (ES) instance (e.g., accessible at http://localhost:9200).

Kibana (optional, for visualization and analytics).

Dependency Installation
You must install the official Elasticsearch Python Client library:

Bash

pip install elasticsearch
‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Prepare Your Data File
Ensure your JSON data file is ready for ingestion. If the script uses the Bulk API for performance, your file may need to be in JSON Lines format (one JSON document per line).

2. Configure the Script (e.g., transfer_data.py)
Elasticsearch Connection Details:
Verify that your Elasticsearch host address, index name, and file path are correctly defined within your Python script:

Python

from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Default Elasticsearch host
ELASTIC_HOST = "http://localhost:9200"
INDEX_NAME = "your_custom_index"
FILE_PATH = "your_data_file.json"

es_client = Elasticsearch([ELASTIC_HOST]) 
3. Execution
Execute the Python script to initiate the data transfer process:

Bash

python transfer_data.py
Upon successful completion, your JSON data will be indexed into the specified Elasticsearch index, ready for querying and visualization in Kibana.
